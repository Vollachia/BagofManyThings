# The Rock of Bral
---
>The Rock was roughly ovaloid in shape, about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) long and half a mile thick on the other two axes. The [gravity plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gravity_plane "Gravity plane") ran through the center lengthwise, such that the Rock had a top side and a bottom side. The city of [Bral](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bral "Bral") was located on the "upper" side. The "bottom" side was government property owned by the ruling prince and contained hangers for his fleet.

>The edges of the Rock were steep and dangerous to climb, so it was challenging to traverse from one side of the asteroid to the other without using a tunnel to pass through. Rescue stations were placed along the edge to recover unfortunate souls who might fall into the gravity plane and begin to drift out into [wildspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wildspace "Wildspace").
>Fresh water on Bral was provided by Lake Bral, a huge chasm plunging deep enough to pass through the gravity plane. The lake was periodically filled with fresh water from harvested ice asteroids. Under normal usage, it needed refilling every 4–7 years, at which point the Bralian Navy located and lassoed an ice asteroid, brought it back, broke it up in space into chunks of 1 ton (910 kilograms) in mass, which were carefully aimed and dropped into the lake until full. All up, the work took up to three months. The water was treated with animal cultures and [waste-eating monsters](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Detritivorous_creatures "Category:Detritivorous creatures") to keep its waters pure for drinking.

>Oxygen and food were produced by vegetation on the lower side of the asteroid. Most of the work at tending the fields and groves was done by convicted criminals as part of their sentence.
>
>Also on the underside were massive vanes, which were enormous sails crafted from the wings of a [radiant dragon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Radiant_dragon "Radiant dragon"). The sails allowed the Rock to be steered slightly as needed in its orbit.
