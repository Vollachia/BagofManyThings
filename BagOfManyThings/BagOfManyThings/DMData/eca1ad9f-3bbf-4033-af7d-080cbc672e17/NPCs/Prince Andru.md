# Prince Andru
---
>Prince Andru was a tall and slim man. His movements were somewhat graceful.
Andru was rarely seen without the accompaniment of two to eight heavily armored bodyguards bearing halberds.

>Intelligent and serious, Andru reminded many of his grandfather Cozar. He cared for few people beyond himself; he was conniving and shrewd, and in his plans, he believed that the ends justified the means. Nevertheless, he had a charming personality with a good sense of humor, was a quiet but capable ruler, and showed great skill in diplomacy. Andru preferred wisdom and patience over force, which caused some to see him as weak.
>Guarded by [[Vladimir Zalenski]].
>Wears a magical crown that makes all think he is the true ruler of Bral.
